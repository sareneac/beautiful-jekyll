Our first task is remembering to throw trash away. From our research we learned that this task exists and is most likely the easiest since students have to remember to throw their trash away on a daily basis. However, we also learned that students oftentimes do not remember to throw their trash away when they are done with it or they do not leave themselves enough time to find and go to a trashcan before their next class despite the constant reminders to throw everything out by surrounding students and teachers throughout the day. Therefore, we are posed with the issue of solving this problem. Going forward, we hope that our app will help remind students to throw their trash away successfully. 

Our second task is throwing your trash away. This task is also existing and also pretty simple because students throw their trash away daily when they are on campus. Despite the simplicity of this task, we learned from our contextual inquiries that there was noticeably stray garbage all around campus. Furthermore, we also learned that there may be too few trash cans on campus which is an issue for someone who is looking to throw away their trash. In addition, it is critical that if students find a garbage can that is overfilled, they find another trash can to prevent garbage from spilling and making an even greater mess. With our app, students will hopefully be more likely to throw their trash away with ease. 

Our third task is throwing stray trash away. Though this task is existing and super straightforward, it is the third hardest because we learned that students are not as likely to pick up other people’s trash if it is left behind because it is technically not their responsibility. In addition, during the pandemic it may not seem sanitary to pick up other peoples food and utensils. However, it is a necessary step to reducing the amount of trash on campus and hopefully will not exist once our app is implemented since everyone will throw their own trash out. 

Our fourth task is reminding other students to throw their trash away. This task is existing, though not used very often, and may be difficult for some students to do since it is nerve racking to speak up if they see other students leaving trash behind or dropping trash around campus. However, it is necessary that they say something to help to reduce the amount of trash on campus. Hopefully by doing so, students will respond and throw their trash out which will limit the amount of people that have to pick up other people's trash. Furthermore, our app will hopefully help to remind every student that they must throw their trash away under all circumstances.

Our fifth task is logging that you threw your trash away. This task is slightly more difficult because it is new and students are not used to it. However, based on our contextual inquiries we feel that it is a necessary step to enforcing that all students throw their trash away. By doing this task, it will force students into successfully throwing their trash away daily to reduce the amount of stray trash around campus.  

Our last and most difficult task is competing with other Horace Mann students to throw the most trash out. This task is new and will hopefully provide a fun and motivating way for students to effectively throw out their trash on campus. Furthermore, after discussing a competition in our contextual inquiries, we heard that it is likely that students will be more likely to throw their trash away with the promise of some sort of reward and also discuss the competition with other students which will remind them to throw their trash away. However, this task is the hardest because it requires students to complete a series of other tasks like remembering to throw trash away, finding garbage cans, throwing trash away, that some struggle to do. 

Design Lab

Design 1: SC
The main focus of this design is our task of competing with the other HM students to throw the most trash out. Since it centers on the motivating factor of our app, this design is very point-oriented and clearly tells the user how to gain points. The idea is that the design will spur app usage and effectiveness due to the emphasis on competition, and thus more trash would be disposed of. The alarm would not be a part of this design, and rather, the reminders to throw out trash are more along the lines of a video game.  This changes the point of the app from being a chore to a fun activity that students would want to partake in to gain more points.  The reminders that might otherwise seem annoying, bring a different perspective of the app to light and ensure that app users throw away their trash while enjoying the app itself.

The alarm replacement notifications support the task of remembering to throw trash away.  They remind the app users to throw their trash away in a unique fashion, and swiping on the notification after unlocking the phone takes users directly to the camera of our app, so that they can take and upload the picture of their trash as they throw it away. 
The camera screen supports the task of throwing the trash away, as it is what is used to take a picture of the trash that is being thrown away.  The existence of this screen enables users to use the app to help throw out their trash, and is accessible through the camera icon on the homepage of the app.
The button on the bottom of the camera screen which says random trash +2pt supports the task of throwing stray trash away.  Selecting this option while taking the picture of the trash the user is throwing out tells the app that this is stray trash vs your own trash, which there is also a button for.  This entices users to throw out trash besides their own, as it would provide more points (the value of 2 points is arbitrary) than only throwing out their own trash.
The leaderboard as well as the heavy points-based design support the task of competing against other HM students.  Simply viewing the homepage of the app shows users the leaderboard and their ranking with both a chart and a written out ranking.  There is also a suggestion of how many pictures/how much trash the user needs to throw out to move up in the rankings, encouraging the task of competition, as well as a line of encouragement at the top of the app’s camera.

The second design is based on notifications, reminders, and the signing up system. The first two drawings represent a phone’s general home screen. On the top of the screen is a notification that reminds the user to throw out their trash, or tells that user that they won the leaderboard. The third drawing shows the home screen of the app, on which there are three options. The bottom two options, “camera” and “leaderboard” both have tiny circles that say “1 new” on them, in order to signify that the user has not-yet-checked notifications to view. The top option reads “set new goals” and is a primary function of the app. The fourth slide shows what happens when the user clicks on this option; three lines pop up and the user is asked to fill in their name, email and school. The use of this is to connect to another program for throwing out trash using the app.

The first two drawings will be completed by clicking on the notifications, similar to any notification one would get on a phone.
The third drawing is also completed by clicking on whatever has the notification bubble, to make said notification disappear. This will take the user to a different page
The fourth drawing requires the user to enter in their name, email, and school so they can be identified and connected to whatever their school’s program is.

Design 3: LP
Our third design is focused on documenting throwing away each user’s food; this includes scanning barcodes, setting alarms, and taking photos of trash cans. The app has a camera that will identify barcodes and once a barcode is successfully scanned, it will allow the user to set an alarm within the app to remind them to throw their food away. Once the user is done with their food, they must take a photo of the item that they scanned previously in a trash can. The users will then be given the option to share their photo to another app, like snapchat or instagram, to post with our custom CleanHM stickers to promote throwing out trash!

To scan the barcode, the app will provide the user with the option to open the camera. The user will then hold their camera up to the barcode on the packaging of their food and the barcode should scan immediately.
After the barcode is scanned, the user will be given the option to set an alarm to remember to throw the item they just scanned out. This page will identify what item the user just scanned and provide a place to enter the time they would like to set their alarm for. To set the alarm, the user simply needs to press “set” at the bottom of the second screen. 
When the user is ready to throw their food out, presumably after their timer has gone off, they should open the camera on the app again. However, this time the user will take a photo of their food in a trash can to insure that they have thrown their food away. 
Once the user has submitted their photo, the app will give them the option to send the photo that they just took to another app with fun custom CleanHM stickers. 

Design 4: DC
The last design is based mainly on the alarm system of the app. The app has a menu with the leaderboard, scan, and an alarm, and you can set the alarm to ring when you finish eating lunch. The task on the menu has three tasks: to press the other three options to take you to the leaderboard, to scan your trash, or to set the alarm to finish your eating. Since the leaderboard and scanner were already drawn, they were omitted from this design. When the alarm rings or goes off, you would throw the trash out; we want all the tasks to be so straightforward to the point that you would unconsciously stop the alarm and get up to throw your trash away. The alarm will work in both the locked screen and in the app screen, acting like the notifications from the Clock app. The difference is that there is no snooze button for the alarm, and only a stop button as throwing out the trash should not be a task to procrastinate or wait on. 

The alarm is created by first pressing the alarm icon on the menu and is used like the Clock app. You would drag or type the numbers to set an alarm for your desired time. In fact, this task is so similar to the Clock app because it is so easy to use. Eventually, the user will not have to think about setting an alarm after doing it a couple times.
Stopping the alarm will also be akin to the Clock app. If you close the screen, the alarm will look the exact same as the Clock app, just without the snooze button. If you were still looking at your phone, it would activate the ringer to vibrate in your hand and a notification that you would swipe up to remove like other clock alarms.
To open the leaderboard page, press the Leadership icon in the app and it will display the top 25 people that have earned the most points by throwing out the most trash.
To open the scanner page, press the Scanner icon in the app and the screen will resemble the camera app, though only with the option of taking pictures. When the picture has been taken, the user can submit it to earn a point.
