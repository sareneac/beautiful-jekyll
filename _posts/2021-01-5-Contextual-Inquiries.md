In this project, we performed three contextual inquiries, all of which involved interviewing participants in the Horace Mann community. 
Since we did this just as the school was transitioning into online classes, we were able to perform inquiries both in-person and online,
leading to different experiences and opinions. Our main takeaways were that students should have more access to garbage cans, and that 
grade wide competitions could be beneficial to encourage students in being environmentally friendly.

First, we interviewed a male student in 10th grade who has a background in wrestling. We interviewed him in the cafeteria, a clean space,
during E period, while all of us were eating together. He told us he does not litter and he does not like the littering that happens on 
campus. We led with questions straight away, in a tone that more or less implied that we had a distaste for littering and wanted his opinion
on how to end it. One of our first questions was: “Why do you think people litter on campus?” This question heavily implies that we think 
littering is bad and that we want to get to the root of it, so we can end it for good at Horace Mann. We learned that he thinks littering 
happens in or around the tents because it is an enclosed space, where it feels less risky and safer to leave one’s food lying around. 
People feel like they have the right to leave their trash and let the maintenance clean it up, with no respect for those faculty members.
On top of that, some tents are far away from the trash cans, and going to them might be a hassle at times. While there may be trash cans in
the tents, they are often smaller and therefore already filled to the brim with trash and food scraps. The student proposed to us that we 
could set up larger trash cans next to all the tents. This way, it would be much easier for a student to throw out their trash. That student 
would see the trash cans upon entering the tents, reminding them that there is a trash can nearby for them to throw their trash out. 
Moreover, on the rare chance that trash is left in the tents, it would be so easy for the maintenance to throw it out as there is a trash can there. 
He was happy to answer our questions, as he is our friend and classmate, and felt comfortable helping us with our mission. We will consider his 
feedback about putting bigger trash cans in more accessible places. For future inquiries, we will have to work even harder. This is because we 
want to interview non-students, including a teacher and a faculty member. For this, we will have to act more professionally, schedule a meeting 
beforehand, and prepare more intricate questions to ask the person.

For the second contextual inquiry, we observed another student. This student is in 11th grade and is very focused on STEM, mainly concerning 
sciences and mathematics. Since he cares about being clean and organized, it is obvious that this student is also heavily against littering on the
HM campus. We interviewed this student online by posting questions for him to answer. These questions were the same as the ones used in the previous
inquiry, with the end goal being to get the student’s opinions on how to solve the problem of littering at school. Uniquely, this student argued 
that littering is an incredibly lazy thing to do. Especially, he said, since there are already trash cans all around campus. When we brought up
the previous student’s idea, he said that that is there. He argued that though the trash cans are not directly in the tents, they are all near 
the tent locations. Moreover, he said that there might be problems regarding placing bigger trash cans inside the tents as those trash cans
might bring bugs and insects into the tents.

For our last contextual inquiry, we were only able to interview due to the closure of school. We met a PE coach over zoom, and she was happy to see
students taking initiative when it comes to littering, and answered our questions in great detail. The questions we used were different from those
used in the first two inquiries considering we were interviewing an adult vs the students we interviewed previously. We first asked for her general
thoughts on littering at HM. She told us that she doesn’t litter, and doesn’t like when others litter, and went on further saying, “I would say
access to garbage cans is probably the biggest thing, if there’s a garbage can you put it away.” This proposal of hers coincides with our group’s 
and our previous interviewees’ thoughts on the matter, with her suggestion of increased amounts of trash cans in key places around campus. As she
is a PE coach, this interview was different than those with students, as she is put in the position where she may feel the need to clean up after 
students. She confirmed this when asked, saying, “It used to be bad in the new building and I felt the need to clean it or get a garbage bag when 
I walked out of the fitness center and saw all the trash.” Our app’s goal is to alleviate that pressure on faculty members as a part of motivating 
students to stop littering. When asked about why she thinks people litter, she said that it’s very easy to get distracted and leave your stuff, so
reminders are important when getting people to remember to throw out their trash. The idea of reminders ties into our idea of motivating students 
to clean up through our app which creates competition. Up until this point, we hadn’t told her what our app was about, and after explaining it to 
her and asking for suggestions or feedback, she said it was a great idea. Her suggestions included grade wide competitions, to take into
consideration how freshmen love to win over the upperclassmen, and that if you spot somebody else’s trash on campus you would gain extra points on
the app. These suggestions are simple enough that we would be able to implement them as part of our app while helping round out the app’s
effectiveness in reducing littering on campus. Another, more general solution to littering was increased access to gloves, because, as she said,
“sometimes people will walk by some trash and not want to pick it up, especially during COVID times.” While we were unable to observe her on
campus due to the online format, her suggestions for and views about littering on the HM campus were crucial to our design process from the 
unique perspective as a faculty member. 

Our first two interviews were able to be conducted in person, while our last was online. The first interview, taking place in the lunchroom, was
conducted during lunchtime, and data was gathered through asking questions and observing the student being interviewed, to get the big picture 
of how students feel and act when it comes to cleaning up. The student-focused most strongly on how littering involves a lack of respect for 
staff and suggested that by providing large trash cans in every tent, students would no longer have excuses for littering as it would be extremely
easy for them to throw out their trash. Our app already aims to reduce the effects of littering on staff besides just littering in general, but
the idea of forcing students to take accountability is helpful. The second interview was also conducted in person but was more of an interview
than an inquiry as it didn’t involve observations of the student. He focused on the laziness of littering and mentioned how the previous student’s
suggestion would not only attract bugs but validate the laziness of the students who litter. This is a valid issue, as we don’t want our outcome 
to have encouraged students to be lazy and passive in taking care of our campus. Our third and final interview was conducted over zoom, this one 
with a PE coach. She offered up several ideas to hone our app’s efficacy and provided us with her valuable thoughts on littering as a staff member.
When creating our app, having multiple perspectives from people of different backgrounds and relationships with the issue we want to solve is 
important. The overall takeaway from all three interviews was that accessibility to trash cans is key, but they also helped us consider other 
problems that could appear so we can deal with them appropriately.

The main users of this app design will be maintenance, faculty, Flik Dining Staff, and students at HM. Maintenance will hopefully no longer have to
clean up as much trash, faculty will monitor Sarene’s trash leaderboards, and Flik Dining staff will put up the barcode in the cafeteria for students
to scan. Students will scan the barcodes and throw out their trash when an alarm goes off. We expect the students (and teachers for that matter) who
use the app to scan their barcodes, throw out their trash when the alarm goes off, and compete on the leaderboards to see who can be the most 
responsible when it comes to not littering. Students will learn how to scan the barcode in the cafeteria and will learn how to set the alarm for their
lunch so that when they finish eating, they throw out their food. The tasks will be performed in the cafeteria, as well as on the field and anywhere 
else where food is eaten. The relationship between the person and data is that the user will change the trash into data by scanning the trash. The 
tools that the users have to include the scanner for the barcode, an alarm to time eating lunch, notifiers or ringers to remind them to throw the trash 
out, and a leaderboard that lists the students who have thrown out the most trash. Concerning communication, not much is needed aside from the 
interaction that comes with being competitive with regards to the leaderboard. By wanting to throw trash out, people are interacting and communicating.
The tasks are performed whenever a person buys food, as that food will be scanned. Each scan should not take more than a second or two, and each 
leaderboard should reset every 3 weeks or one month. If the scan does not work the faculty member can hopefully just trust the student to do the right
thing. People should still respect the honor code and not lie about buying lunch to scan the barcode. In the rare case that the leaderboards get shut 
down, nothing should be too much of a problem as that is a setback for everyone, so everyone should still be on the same field. If the notifiers for 
eating lunch stop working because they were disabled by the user, the ringers will still work. If both are disabled, there will be flashes on the 
person’s screen to tell them to throw out their trash.

Who is going to use the design?
This design will be used by Horace Mann middle and upper school students.

What tasks do they now perform?
Some students throw out their food when they are done with it but many do not. 

What tasks are desired?
It is desired that every student throws out their food when they are done. 

How are the tasks learned?
Students do not need to learn how to throw trash out but our app will help motivate students to do so. 

Where are the tasks performed?
The tasks are performed on the Horace Mann campus.

What is the relationship between the person and data?
Students will contribute to the data we collect because they will confirm that they have thrown out their food by taking and submitting a photo. 

What other tools does the person have?
In the app, the person has a camera to scan garbage and an alarm they can use. 

How do people communicate with each other?
There is no form of direct communication on this app but there is a leaderboard for who records throwing out the most trash.  

How often are the tasks performed?
The task should be performed at least once a day during the student’s lunch period. 

What are the time constraints on the tasks?
There is an allotted amount of time that each person will have after they scan the barcode on their food before they receive a notification reminding them to throw everything out. 

What happens when things go wrong?
When the app malfunctions, we want it to run a code where the app will shut down for 15-30 minutes, only closing the app from receiving data of scanned garbage people took but not the alarm.
