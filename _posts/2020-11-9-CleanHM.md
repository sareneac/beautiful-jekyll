We were interested in solving the problem of littering around campus because the problem has escalated throughout this particular year. As a result of the coronavirus and the protocols that come with it, students are required to eat outside and often forget to throw away their food and garbage. If the students continue to not throw their trash out, these bad habits might carry over to following years in Horace Mann, setting a really bad image for our school.  Not only that, but they are creating extra work for others, often staff members, who end up picking after them. We were motivated to solve this problem as it seems like such an inconsiderate inaction to not throw your food away. Moreover, creating an app that combats the inaction of throwing garbage away seems challenging and quite fun to develop. We think we may not be able to complete an app that includes everything we want from it, so it would be a good challenge to try.

This year, students have spent an increased amount of time on the field, under tents and, in general, outside. This time outside is a direct result of the global pandemic, as students are encouraged to be outside since it's a lot more corona friendly than being indoors. The majority of students also eat their lunches outside; since some students don’t pick up after themselves, there’s a lot of trash on the field. The extra garbage is an issue because the students who don’t throw away their trash end up creating more work for the maintenance staff. As Señor Dalo has addressed in multiple emails that have not been heeded, there is no maid service at HM. Any member of the staff who picks up after students is doing something that they shouldn’t have to. Not only are they creating extra work for others and littering on campus, but the students who leave their trash everywhere are being inconsiderate and lazy. There are trash cans all over campus; it’s simply a question of entitlement.  Clearly, students have the capability of cleaning up after themselves, they are just lacking motivation.

The first participant we want to interview is a Horace Mann student, preferably in the upper division. We will most likely stop someone in the hall and make sure to socially distance with them as we ask them questions. The second participant will be a Horace Mann teacher. This will be more cleanly set up, as one of us could schedule a meeting with one of our teachers and ask them questions. The meeting will be carried out like a standard student-teacher meeting, which teachers generally make sure are socially distanced. Finally, we want to interview a HM maintenance staff member. To accomplish this we will figure out how to politely request an interview with someone who cleans the field or looks after the food, and we will find a safe space (at least six feet apart) to really get a feel of how frustrating it is to clean up after Horace Mann students. We believe we will be able to accomplish this in one week, either by scheduling times beforehand or splitting up to interview people separately.
