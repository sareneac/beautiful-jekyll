This image shows the page of our app in which users set alarms by filling in numbers in the blank boxes and then clicking the 'set' button.

The left screen is the scanning screen in which users scan their trash, and the cutout part of the screen simulates the camera. The right screen is the home screen with the app icon for our app on the bottom-middle left.
