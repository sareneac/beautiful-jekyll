The test was conducted with my grandma in my home. I chose my grandma because my grandparents are not the most familiar with the technology. Therefore, if she can use the app, then everyone at Horace Mann should be able to use the app. The environment was chosen because she usually stays at home. I could have conducted it in her bedroom, but decided to just start where she was, which was in our living room. I introduced her to the project by showing her the sheets and gave the scenario that she wanted to throw trash out. She did not understand how the photo and leaderboard fit into the app, which is why a help panel is very necessary. For example, she was confused about how the photo gave a point nor understood what the points were for. She did know how the alarm works because she has used the clock alarm before, so not much had to change there. The team members did not play the largest role, but I did change the paper prototype from only my pictures to all four of ours’. I learned that it was not the most ideal to choose my grandma because she wouldn’t be one of the people to use the app in the first place, but couldn’t really choose anyone else because I had too much work to do. However, I do think the takeaways were still beneficial, for a help panel that does not have too many words and takes someone through the app will help everyone. (Written by Darson)

The second usability test trial was conducted with a Horace Mann student. I began by introducing the buttons and our intent for the app and proceeded to walk through the interfaces. The user did not have many comments on the leaderboard or photo pages, but she did inquire about the help page that we do not currently have an interface for. Though, we have decided that the help button will show each page with arrows that indicate what to do. In addition, she noted that she thought it would make more sense for the alarm to be set up by period as opposed to time. For example, the options would read “beginning of E, middle of E, end of E” instead of 12:30. We originally created the alarm with the time because it is the same set up as the iPhone alarm app which most users have experience with. However, we are now considering changing it because many do not know when each period begins and ends. However, we could keep the same interface and just add a photo or text that tells the user when each period begins and ends. (Written by Loren)

The last usability test trial was conducted with another Horace Mann student. I first showed him the pictures and new reforms made to them in the Library, and proceeded to allow him to use the pictures. The final user did not comment much, only questioning the buttons we used for our paper prototype. The buttons were too specific to the point that they did not make sense. Having a button say next and back is probably much easier. Also, there were no back buttons, instead you had to go through the entire process and not be allowed to edit anything. Because of this, we finished much earlier, though the majority of the prototype quickly went through and glances were made. After all the reforms, there should not have been that many problems anyway. (Written by Darson)

The two revisions we think are the most important are the help page and a clear photo page. The help page will walk through the entire app for someone with good images and pictures to illustrate the uses. The photo page was originally too vague and not understandable. For example, we did not clarify what the photo was for before taking one, how many points it even gave, and what part of the objects to take the picture for. But now, the photo page is much more clear and gives instructions before use.

Positive Incidents: Generally accessible for even old people, The alarm page is very similar to the alarm section in the Clock app, so it was easy to use, The buttons were clearer after changes.

Negative Incidents: need a more prominent help page, Confusing photo page and unclear how it works, The leaderboard go to the photo page with a button that doesn’t say “go to photo page”, The alarm app should have the times and the periods corresponding to the Horace Mann classes, Buttons are too specific, maybe change the buttons to say next, Add back buttons instead of a home button.
