Problem Definition and Proposed Solution Overview
As a result of the pandemic, students tend to spend more time outside and as such, litter more often. 
This is because on the field, there are fewer easily accessible trash cans than inside the buildings. 
Resultantly, most of the time people forget about their litter on the field, which is why our app acts as motivation to throw out trash. 
By creating competition through a point system, leaderboard, and prizes, Clean HM encourages and reminds users to throw out their trash 
and aims to reduce the amount of litter on campus. 
Contextual Inquiry Results & Key Tasks
In this project, we performed three contextual inquiries, all of which involved interviewing participants in the Horace Mann community.
First, we interviewed an 11th grader who expressed his dislike for littering and suggested that there be more trash cans around the field, 
bigger trash cans, and trash cans closer to the tents. Second, we interviewed another 11th grader, who agreed that littering is lazy 
and immoral but disagreed that there should be bigger trash cans, especially in the tents, because bugs and insects could be more attracted
to them. For the third inquiry, we interviewed a PE coach and she was happy to see students taking initiative when it comes to littering,
and made her opinion clear that she was not lenient with littering. She went further to say: “I would say access to garbage cans is probably 
the biggest thing, if there’s a garbage can you put it away.” Since we did this just as the school was transitioning into online classes,
we were only able to perform the first of the three inquiries. Then, we were able to perform inquiries online, leading to different experiences 
and opinions. Our main takeaways were that students should have more access to garbage cans and that grade-wide competitions could be 
beneficial to encourage students in being environmentally friendly.
Initial Paper Prototype

The first screen is the scanning screen in which users scan their trash, and the cutout part of the screen simulates the camera. 
The second screen is the home screen with the app icon for our app on the bottom-middle left. The third screen is the page of our
app in which users set alarms by filling in numbers in the blank boxes and then clicking the ‘set’ button. The fourth screen is 
the home screen for the app, with three buttons: Leaderboard, Photo, and Alarm. The fifth screen is for when a point has been added
when you have taken a picture of the trash. From here, you can go back to the home page, the leaderboard page, or take another
photo to gain more points. The final screen is the leaderboard screen that shows the number of points you have, how far you are away
from 1st place, and how many points the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place have.
Usability Testing Process & Results
Our testing consisted of an elderly individual and two HM students. We tested them by laying the paper prototypes out in front of them
and simulated a mock test. The elderly individual had trouble understanding the photo and leaderboard buttons but did understand how
the alarm worked as it was very similar to the iPhone clock alarm. We concluded that an FAQ page was required for the app. However,
the first HM student had critiqued the alarm, saying it should be personalized for HM students and use periods instead of the clock
alarm’s scrolling of time; this suggestion is now implemented into the design. The second HM student critiqued the buttons, saying 
they were too specific and confusing and should use vague buttons like “next” and “back”. This suggestion has also been taken and 
will be implemented. With these comments and the ones from our classmates, we have made the app more heuristically applicable, with
more simple and efficient usage. 
Final Paper Prototype

The first change we made was to the camera screen. We made that screen less resemble the standard iPhone camera, and instead designed
a simplified camera with a single scan button. Second, we added a sort of help screen; when the user clicks on the “help” button labels
will pop up explaining each button on the home screen. Third, we replaced the times on the alarm screen with selectable school periods,
from A to H, in a drop-down menu. Finally, we added “Next” and “Back” buttons to every screen, to simplify that aspect.
Digital Mockup & Testing Results
Present your digital mockup. Convey the critical aspects of your design, including how users will accomplish your two primary tasks
(one short paragraph per task). Briefly discuss any changes you needed to make as you switched to your digital tools instead of paper. 
Outline the procedure and describe the participant(s) of your final round of testing and the motivation behind choosing the specific UX
research method you chose for this final stage.
The two primary tasks of our app are taking/submitting photos and setting alarms to ensure that the users are throwing away their garbage.
In order to take and submit photos, the user is provided with the option of taking a photo in the app or uploading a photo from their camera
roll. If they choose to take a photo, a standard iPhone camera screen will pop up. Once the user has taken their photo, a new screen will
appear with the photo they just took and the option to retake or submit it. However, if the user were to choose to upload a photo, a screen 
with their photo albums will appear in which they will select a photo. In order to confirm that the user chose the correct photo, they will
be shown the same screen as mentioned previously which allows them to reselect or upload their photo. The concept of this task is still the 
same as our paper prototype but it now has more screens and options to make the user experience better. Furthermore, we made additions to the 
high fidelity prototype which mimic standard iPhone functions.  
In order to set timers in the app, the user is given a screen with the times of each period (A-H), and three time options (beginning, middle, 
and end) to set an alarm for. Instead of providing the users with the timing of each period and allowing them to input the times of the alarms
themselves, we decided that our three options would make the process of setting up alarms much easier and less error prone. Since our main tasks
require the prototype to be highly functional in order to mimic what the official app would look like, we decided that using Invision was the best option.
In addition, Invision has downloadable IOS features that were particularly appealing to us.   
Discussion
In more depth, discuss the results of your last round of testing with the digital mockup. Reflect upon and discuss your project as a whole and
the results of your extensive research. For example:
What did you learn from the process of iterative design?
We learned how to correctly go through a design process, to brainstorm ideas, create prototypes, listen to critiques, and figure out a rough idea of how our app will look if created.
How did the process shape your final design?
The process allowed for us to be critiqued by our peers and others to better improve our design. All comments were taken and thought about, and
nearly all were implemented.
Do you think you could have used more, or fewer, iterations on your design?
We think we could have used fewer iterations as the process took so long, and believe the process could have been more efficient and taken fewer
classes if class time was more for working.
If you were to pursue this project further, and plan to actually implement and release it to the public, what would you want to do? What future
research would be necessary?
If we were to pursue this project further, we would want to modify our app to better suit HM students and try to start the software of the app.
Additionally, we would have to research how many people would use the app, how often to update it, figure out the bugs, and learn the software
to identify certain objects.
