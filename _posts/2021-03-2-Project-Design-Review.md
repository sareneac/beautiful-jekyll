We chose a combination of all four of our designs, given that we all drew aspects of the main app. In turn, 
that means all the critiques are important as we are combining all the designs into one app. Since many of 
the critiques were on the barcodes and scanner, we decided to change from a scanner and barcode to a photograph.
The problems with the barcode and scanner were that barcodes had to be put on all pieces of trash, which 
isn’t realistic, and the scanner would make it impossible to customize your pictures as the pictures would only
be of barcodes. Additionally, a scanner is essentially a more specialized photograph, which we do not need. 
The photograph allows us to easily take a picture without barcodes and customize the pictures. Secondly, 
many people believed the alarms should have snoozing capabilities given that it’s impossible to pinpoint 
when someone is going to finish eating. Moreover, the alarms may go off in class if the user sets it incorrectly
and quickly turning your phone off snoozes the alarm and does not stop the alarm. So if we disabled snoozing,
the alarm continues to ring even if the user turns off the phone, making the user take it out again to stop the alarm.
