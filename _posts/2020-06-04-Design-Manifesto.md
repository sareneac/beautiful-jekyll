How did the design process impact the decisions you made? What were the most valuable parts of the process? 
What were the limitations to the design process that you encountered?
Throughout the Mobile Apps year, I have learned what the design process entails, yet believe the design process
seems a bit slow and very methodical. There should be decisions that take less time, to accelerate the process 
from a brainstorm to a paper prototype. For example, I believe the most important part of the process was the 
brainstorm, figuring out an idea to make, but the entire design process seemed to limit the creativity and main
aspects of the brainstormed design. Before I started Mobile Apps, I have already done a makeshift design process,
brainstorming a design for an autonomous drone working in the ocean to collect plastic, but that process was much
faster, not taking into account many problems of the design. Now, after the class, I understand important designs
and concepts should be taken slower, with more time to understand other peoplesâ€™ perspectives and problems with a
design. Therefore, the design can be properly corrected and fixed before a high level prototype. Furthermore, the
time spent between brainstorming and creating a paper prototype seemed to blur by; though very slow, the majority 
of the time does not seem to be the most important portion of the design process. Secondly, the most enjoyable part 
of the process was the final high level prototype on InVision, to use the computer to create our physical prototype 
into the screen. During the InVision process, our group collaborated the best, working together on the design while 
also writing the paragraphs for our UI Design Experience. We had the best chemistry working and doing designs, not 
during paper prototypes or interviews. Due to this, I believe working more on the computer together is better for 
groups on a nonprofessional stage. 
Expectations did not meet reality when we wished for more time to study coding or Swift. Though we had only a couple
days to work and learn Swift, we worked happily on the language and wanted more of the class for learning the language.
At the start of the year, we believed we could code more, creating more parts of an actual app to show development and
skill, but that was sadly not possible due to the length of the design process and the Coronavirus severely cutting time.
Additionally, I believed Swift would be far different, being solely code and different methods, but there was an entire 
scratch-like portion that allowed for the drag and dropping of parts of an app onto a mock iPhone. The addition was interesting,
but definitely for the best, surpassing my expectations but at the same time a little disappointing as it was as if I was
using scratch again, considered a simple language. However, learning the design process was very important and an integral
part of learning necessary for future designs. Nonetheless, the early moments in the year could have been more for learning
other languages before starting the design process, not interfering with the design process.
The interviews, due to the Coronavirus, were more challenging than they should have been. Time had to be scheduled online,
when many students and faculty members were teaching or preparing work. Because of this, the time for interviews seemed to 
drag along, severely cutting the time we had for other Mobile Apps activities. This time could have been for Swift, or finishing
the design process faster, but the pandemic shortened the time for the class. During the moments online, I learned how to work
out of school better for Mobile Apps. Because we only had one class per week, the time in between had to be used for other classes,
but balancing that time for mobile apps also occurred. I spent time talking with my group to learn cooperation and learning 
together with Swift.  
The user testing, in my opinion, was a poorer use of time, compared to creating a CAD or InVision prototype first before doing
the user testing as then we would have a better quality prototype. Though it would be a more waste of time if the prototype would
not be used, it would give a better insight on what the prototype would look like. This is important as the prototype, on a
nonprofessional level, should be more enjoyable to create. Nonetheless, I believe the entire design process, though tedious,
is the best way possible for professional creation and invention of apps. On the professional level, the slow and methodical 
process should be maintained, given a single problem or inaccuracy may cause the app or software to be used less and unappealing 
for the public. Before I took the class, I would have believed the inventions we currently have would be created far faster. For
example, over the summer, a team of five including me created a CAD model immediately, following a rapid design process that spanned
only a couple weeks. The CAD model, along with a 3DS Max animation, was created to perfection; however, the design was slightly 
flawed, causing the CAD and animation to be perfectly, slightly flawed.
